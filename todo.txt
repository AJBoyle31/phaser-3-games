        - asteroid/ship collision - DONE
        - restart game on spacebar press (needs text too) - DONE
        - add high score to top right - have it update - DONE
        - as score gets higher, throttle shots and increase astroid speed - DONE
        - 
    - set up Menu for game selection
        - work on tweens for either starfield or spaceship

Can pass data to scene, get data from create() function

Cat Fighter (https://opengameart.org/content/cat-fighter-sprite-sheet) & (https://opengameart.org/content/cat-fighter-addon1-energy-force-master-kit)
    - 50x50px (i think)
        In effect sprite sheet
        - small effect = 1 fame is 32 * 32 pixel 
        - big effect = 1 fame is 64 * 64 pixel  
    - Need to move sprite to container to be able to add hit boxes
        - http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/14840-separate-hitboxes-for-attack-animations/
    - Add fireball json
    - Add fireball group to sprite (might work best after container is figured out)
